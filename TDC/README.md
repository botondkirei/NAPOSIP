# Time-to-Digital Converter
Time-to-Digital converters (TDC) are key components in many application: physics, electronics, tsc, just to name a few. TDCs are deployed in All Digital Phase/Frequency Locked Loops for frequency/phase measurement. In this directory simulation models for Delay Line, Vernier Delay Line and Gated Ring Oscillator TDC are given. The models are described in VHDL (based on PAElib, to enable power and area estimation) and CPPSim (CPPSim has uses a GUI to develop the simulation models).
## TDC topologies suited for digital synthesis
### Delay-Line TDC
The delay line TDC is composed of a cascade of delay components. 
### Vernier Delay-Line TDC
### Gated Ring Oscillator TDC
### Vernier Oscillator TDC
