The intention of NAPOSIP Project is to create a fully synthesizable All-Digital Phase/Frequency Locked Loop (FS-ADPLL). 
The common ADPLL topologies consists of several components, such as Voltage/Digitally Controlled Oscillators (V/DCO), 
high freqyuency presacller, programmable frequency dividers, FIR filters, Time-to-Digital Converters (TDC), etc.
To achive a fully synthesiable PLL, these aformentioned components are described in VHDL. This repostory hold the source code
and related documentation of such components.

Traditionally, ADPLLs are designed in a full custom IC design flow (including the digital components). Whenever the design 
is migrated on a new technology almoust every component has to be redesigned from scrach. S
